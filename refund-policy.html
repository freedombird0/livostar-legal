  <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

  <p>At Livostar, customer satisfaction is our priority. If you are not satisfied with your subscription, you may request a refund within 14 days of purchase, provided you have not made significant use of the service (such as exceeding daily swipes or premium features).</p>

  <p>Refund requests must be submitted via our support email at starlivepro@web.de
    . We reserve the right to decline refund requests if abuse is suspected.</p>

  <p>For lifetime memberships, refund eligibility is within the first 30 days of purchase only.</p>
